# Arian's DL/TS primer

This is a list of what to learn if you want to do deep learning based on my own personal opinion. My biases are:
* I like neuroscience
* I am not as good at math and programming as I would like to be (yet)
* I like pretty pictures
* My PhD was on traffic forecasting, so there are more stuff on timeseries and graph.

## Basics (from literal zero):
* Learn the most advanced math that is typically available in highschool (Like IB Math HL) : https://www.khanacademy.org/
* Learn Python
* https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/
* https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks
* https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction
* Yann LeCun's NYU Deep Learning course https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLSP21/
* Bishop's PRML

## Tools: 
* https://lightning.ai/pytorch-lightning
* https://pytorch-geometric-temporal.readthedocs.io/
* https://wandb.ai/
* https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tensorboard_with_pytorch.html

## Time Series
* Amazon's Big TS tutorial https://www.amazon.science/videos-and-tutorials/forecasting-big-time-series-theory-and-practice
* Swiss AI Lab tutorial: https://gmlg.ch/tutorials/graph-based-processing/ecml-2023 https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15978

## Basic Concepts:
* Universal Approximation Theorem
* Manifold Hypothesis and NeuralODE
* Yann LeCun
	* Self-Supervised Learning https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12210
	* Energy Based Models (taught in his course https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLSP21/)
	* JEPA https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf
* Geometric Deep Learning https://geometricdeeplearning.com/

## Useful Concepets:
* Nervous System (biology): 
	* Action potential, synapse, connectome
	* synaptic plasticity, Hebbian theory, why "a brain that heals easily cannot learn".
	* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_specialization_(brain) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_cell
* Non-Backprop ANN: Kohonen's self-organizing map, Boltzmann Machine, Helmholtz Machine, Spiking Neural Network
* Karl Friston Free energy principle / predictive coding / active inference / Anil Seth: The hallucination of consciousness
* A statistical perspective of deep learning https://deeplearningtheory.com/
* Information Theory https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf
* Type theory and functional programming https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/
* Category Theory https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSdFiFTAI4sQ0Rg4BIZcNnU-45I9DI-VB
